edit available time
calendar solution
    -bootstrap calendar
        -convert event times to milliseconds unix time
        -create dict of events and then dump to json
        -make sure the json is correct (eg success= {1} at the beginning)

teacher should be able to view a list of all events that do not have a sub assigned to them yet and commit to it right then. It should prompt the teacher
whether they really want to accept the event or not.

core business logic
--after creating an event, show a list of teachers who are availble. submit another form to send out emails to the teachers.
--first teacher who clicks will get the event, next teachers will just get click points.
--send confirmation email to client
