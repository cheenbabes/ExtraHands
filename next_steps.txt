calendar solution
    -bootstrap calendar
        -convert event times to milliseconds unix time
        -create dict of events and then dump to json
        -make sure the json is correct (eg success= {1} at the beginning)

teacher should be able to view a list of all events that do not have a sub assigned to them yet and commit to it right then. It should prompt the teacher
whether they really want to accept the event or not.

core business logic
--after creating an event, show a list of teachers who are available. submit another form to send out emails to the teachers.
    --create a view and url pattern that takes a list of teacher tokens and emails each of them with a unique link
    --another view and url pattern for the teachers to click on to confirm their participation in the event
--first teacher who clicks will get the event, next teachers will just get click points.
--send confirmation email to client


clicks for teacher should be it's own separate object with 2 fields, teacher.token and event.token that form a composite primary key. That way it can only be triggered once
