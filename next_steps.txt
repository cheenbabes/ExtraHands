===CALENDAR===
calendar solution
    -bootstrap calendar
        -convert event times to milliseconds unix time
        -create dict of events and then dump to json (or a list because they're ordered)
        -make sure the json is correct (eg success= {1} at the beginning)

===TEACHERS===
--If an event has been submitted but no teacher has been assigned to it
teacher should be able to view a list of all events that do not have a sub assigned to them yet and commit to it right then. It should prompt the teacher
whether they really want to accept the event or not. (maybe if there's been no teacher for more than 7 days, then it becomes open??)

--allow teachers to modify some things on their account
    --time in between events (in hours)

===BUSINESS LOGIC===
==STORY 6==
    --Port the project to VS is the next step and going through deployment to azure

--some kind of billing/account tracking system??
    --regular hourly rate
    --on call hourly rate

==STORY 3==
    -clients should be able to see which teachers they already contacted and see a notification if more teachers have become available. Also, they should not be able to
    email any teacher twice. Add a field to Event that has a list of time tokens since available teachers are shown based on individual times.
        -implementation
            --for every event in pending events, get all the times available and store them as a list of available times on the event
            --when a teacher is emailed, add that time to another list.
            --get the diff between the two lists and retrieve that number.



===Accounts===
===FEATURE===
Each client has an account
An account holds many receipts
Each receipt has an event and all the details.

A receipt is sent for payment processing. Account.balance keeps track of how much the client owes.
A daily job scans the account balance. There is a field called date overdue which tracks when the account went overdue.
If the account becomes 7 days overdue, the user is suspended.

FINISHED STORIES

==STORY 1==DONE
    -override form.is_valid() method on EventForm and AvailableTimeForm to make sure that the end time is always
    greater than the start time


==STORY 4== DONE
    -make it possible for teachers to delete times and clients should be able to delete events IF they have not emailed any teachers yet.
    -clients should see a prompt when they go to the select teacher page on whether they want to continue as they will not be able to edit or delete the event afterwards

==STORY 0== DONE
core business logic
--after creating an event, show a list of teachers who are available. submit another form to send out emails to the teachers.
    --create a view and url pattern that takes a list of teacher tokens and emails each of them with a unique link
    --another view and url pattern for the teachers to click on to confirm their participation in the event
--first teacher who clicks will get the event, next teachers will just get click points.
--send confirmation email to client
