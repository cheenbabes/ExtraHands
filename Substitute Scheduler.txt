Business Flow
==============

A client can log on and create event in the future or immediately hire a teacher. 
If a client chooses immediate hire, a list of teachers on call are displayed. The client then selects all the teachers
they are interested in and clicks submit. Those teachers receive emails which have a unique link in them. The teacher that clicks the
link first will get the event, the event will close, and an email will be sent to the client confirming the event and attaching the teacher's
details.
If a client chooses future hire, a list of the teachers which have time slots of availability is displayed. The rest of the flow is the same.
If a teacher has to cancel after agreeing to the event, they must contact the client personally. 
If an event does not have a teacher within 12 hours of start_time, an email is sent to every teacher asking them to sign up.
