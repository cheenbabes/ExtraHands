    <p><strong>How This Works</strong></p>
    <p>Select as many teachers as you would like to invite to your event. If you have a specific teacher in mind, only check their box. All the teachers that you select will
    receive an email with a unique link to register for your event. The first teacher that clicks on their link will be assigned to your event. We will notify you as
    soon as that happens through email.
